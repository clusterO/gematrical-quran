#### Godel Numbering
The number might be a concatenation instead of the actual method (Sum)

- ASCII number (000-127)
- Pad to 3 digits
- Concatenate

Godel used a system based on prime factorization

1- Map Symbols to Natural numbers

0 - 1 || => - 3 || ( - 5 ||  ) - 7

###### Godel encoding of a seqence is the product of the first n prime to the corespending values in the sequence
enc(x1, x2, x3, ..., xn) = 2^x1 . 3^x2 . 5^x3. ... . Pn^xn

A number obtained in this way can be uniquely factorized into prime factors
###### Godel used this scheme at two levels:
> - To encode sequences of symbols representing formulae
> - To encode sequences of formulae representing proofs

This allows to show correspondance between statements

#### Other Formulations : 
- Nagel and newman encoding
